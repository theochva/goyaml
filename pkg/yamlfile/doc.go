/*
Package yamlfile provides a simple wrapper around a YAML file's contents.

This package is intended to be used when you need to quickly read/write
a handful values from a YAML file.

You basically avoid having to go through the process of "modeling" the YAML
file with a struct or having to dig through a map map[interface{}]interface{}
to read/write a handful of values.
